Welcome to Open Standup!

## Rules

1. Don't talk about proprietary stuff.
2. DO NOT talk about corp/NDA/confidential/anything-that-might-get-you-in-legal-trouble stuff!
3. If someone yells "parking lot!" or double âœŒ's...the topic is over.
4. Minimum 5 shares per stand-up.
5. Only one person sharing at a time.
6. The repos are OSS. No closed source...no rights reserved...no per-core seats...
